    Gas-phase oxidation routes of biogenic emissions, mainly isoprene and
    monoterpenes, in the atmosphere are still the subject of intensive research
    with special attention being paid to the formation of aerosol constituents.
    This laboratory study shows that the most abundant monoterpenes (limonene
    and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene) form highly oxidized RO2 radicals with up
    to 12 O atoms, along with related closed-shell products, within a few
    seconds after the initial attack of ozone or OH radicals. The overall
    process, an intramolecular ROO{\textrightarrow}QOOH reaction and subsequent
    O2 addition generating a next R'OO radical, is similar to the well-known
    autoxidation processes in the liquid phase (QOOH stands for a
    hydroperoxyalkyl radical). Field measurements show the relevance of this
    process to atmospheric chemistry. Thus, the well-known reaction principle
    of autoxidation is also applicable to the atmospheric gas- phase oxidation
    of hydrocarbons leading to extremely low-volatility products which
    contribute to organic aerosol mass and hence influence the
    aerosol-cloud-climate system.
