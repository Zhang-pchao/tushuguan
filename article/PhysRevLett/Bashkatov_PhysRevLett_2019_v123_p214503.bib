    The dynamics of hydrogen bubbles produced via electrolysis in acidic
    electrolytes is studied in a combination of experiments and numerical
    simulations. A transition from monotonic to oscillatory bubble growth is
    observed after 2/3 of the bubble lifetime, if the electric potential
    exceeds -3{\,}{\,}V. This work analyzes characteristic features of the
    oscillations in terms of bubble geometry, the thickness of the microbubble
    carpet, and the oscillation frequency. An explanation of the oscillation
    mechanisms is provided by the competition between buoyancy and electric
    force, the magnitude of which depends on the carpet thickness. Both the
    critical carpet thickness at detachment and the oscillation frequencies of
    the bubble as predicted by the model agree well with the experiment.
