    A novel instrument allows for the first time measurements of the lateral
    adhesion forces at a solid-liquid interface, f(parallel), in a way that is
    decoupled from the normal forces, f(perpendicular). We use it to measure
    how f(parallel) between a drop and a surface is influenced by different
    f(perpendicular) and different histories of drop resting periods on the
    surface prior to sliding, t(rest). The variation of f(parallel) with
    t(rest) is similar for different f(perpendicular) and always plateaus as
    t(rest)--{\ensuremath{>}}infinity. We show that the f(parallel) plateau
    value is higher when f(perpendicular) is lower. This seemingly
    counterintuitive result is in agreement with recent theories.
