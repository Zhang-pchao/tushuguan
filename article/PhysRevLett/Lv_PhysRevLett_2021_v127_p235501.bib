    The removal of microbubbles from substrates is crucial for the efficiency
    of many catalytic and electrochemical gas evolution reactions in liquids.
    The current work investigates the coalescence and detachment of bubbles
    generated from catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Self-propelled
    detachment, induced by the coalescence of two bubbles, is observed at sizes
    much smaller than those determined by buoyancy. Upon coalescence, the
    released surface energy is partly dissipated by the bubble oscillations,
    working against viscous drag. The remaining energy is converted to the
    kinetic energy of the out-of-plane jumping motion of the merged bubble. The
    critical ratio of the parent bubble sizes for the jumping to occur is
    theoretically derived from an energy balance argument and found to be in
    agreement with the experimental results. The present results provide both
    physical insight for the bubble interactions and practical strategies for
    applications in chemical engineering and renewable energy technologies like
    electrolysis.
