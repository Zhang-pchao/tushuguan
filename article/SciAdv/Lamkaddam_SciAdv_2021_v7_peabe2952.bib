    Aerosols still present the largest uncertainty in estimating anthropogenic
    radiative forcing. Cloud processing is potentially important for secondary
    organic aerosol (SOA) formation, a major aerosol component: however,
    laboratory experiments fail to mimic this process under atmospherically
    relevant conditions. We developed a wetted-wall flow reactor to simulate
    aqueous-phase processing of isoprene oxidation products (iOP) in cloud
    droplets. We find that 50 to 70{\%} (in moles) of iOP partition into the
    aqueous cloud phase, where they rapidly react with OH radicals, producing
    SOA with a molar yield of 0.45 after cloud droplet evaporation. Integrating
    our experimental results into a global model, we show that clouds
    effectively boost the amount of SOA. We conclude that, on a global scale,
    cloud processing of iOP produces 6.9 Tg of SOA per year or approximately
    20{\%} of the total biogenic SOA burden and is the main source of SOA in
    the mid-troposphere (4 to 6 km).
