    A molecular-level understanding of the catalyst-electrolyte interface under
    realistic operating conditions remains a central challenge in
    electrocatalysis. In particular, the role of the electrochemical potential
    in modulating interfacial solvation, and its consequences for CO2
    electroreduction, has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, using machine
    learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, an explicit solvent
    model within the grand canonical DFT framework, and enhanced sampling
    techniques, we systematically investigate the impact of the working
    potentials on CO2 reduction process at the Ag(111)/H2O interface. Our
    results reveal that the applied potential significantly reshapes the
    orientation of interfacial water and modulate the strength of hydrogen-bond
    network. This collective solvent response to the electric potential plays
    an important role in stabilizing reactive intermediates, regulating
    reaction kinetics, and facilitating key steps such as proton transfer and
    hydroxide diffusion. These findings underscore the critical role of solvent
    dynamics in CO2 reduction, highlighting the importance of simulating
    electrochemical reactions under realistic operating conditions. Rather than
    acting as a passive background medium, the solvent emerges as a dynamic,
    potential- sensitive participant that plays an active role in the catalytic
    process.
