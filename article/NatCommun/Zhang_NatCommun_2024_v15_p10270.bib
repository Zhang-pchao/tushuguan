    The electrical double layer (EDL) at metal oxide-electrolyte interfaces
    critically affects fundamental processes in water splitting, batteries, and
    corrosion. However, limitations in the microscopic-level understanding of
    the EDL have been a major bottleneck in controlling these interfacial
    processes. Herein, we use ab initio-based machine learning potential
    simulations incorporating long-range electrostatics to unravel the
    molecular-scale picture of the EDL at the prototypical anatase
    TiO2-electrolyte interface under various pH conditions. Our large-scale
    simulations, capable of capturing interfacial water
    dissociation/recombination reactions and electrolytic proton transport,
    provide unprecedented insights into the detailed structure of the EDL.
    Moreover, the larger capacitance of the EDL under basic relative to acidic
    conditions, originating from the higher affinity of the cations for the
    oxide surface, is found to give rise to distinct charging mechanisms on
    negative and positive surfaces. Our results are validated by the agreement
    between the computed EDL capacitance and experimental data.
