    Aerosol affects Earth's climate and the health of its inhabitants. A major
    contributor to aerosol formation is the oxidation of volatile organic
    compounds. Monoterpenes are an important class of volatile organic
    compounds, and recent research demonstrate that they can be converted to
    low-volatility aerosol precursors on sub-second timescales following a
    single oxidant attack. The {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene + O3 system is
    particularly efficient in this regard. However, the actual mechanism behind
    this conversion is not understood. The key challenge is the steric strain
    created by the cyclobutyl ring in the oxidation products. This strain
    hinders subsequent unimolecular hydrogen-shift reactions essential for
    lowering volatility. Using quantum chemical calculations and targeted
    experiments, we show that the excess energy from the initial ozonolysis
    reaction can lead to novel oxidation intermediates without steric strain,
    allowing the rapid formation of products with up to 8 oxygen atoms. This is
    likely a key route for atmospheric organic aerosol formation.
