    Water adsorption and dissociation processes on pristine low-index TiO2
    interfaces are important but poorly understood outside the well- studied
    anatase (101) and rutile (110). To understand these, we construct three
    sets of machine learning potentials that are simultaneously applicable to
    various TiO2 surfaces, based on three density-functional-theory
    approximations. Here we show the water dissociation free energies on seven
    pristine TiO2 surfaces, and predict that anatase (100), anatase (110),
    rutile (001), and rutile (011) favor water dissociation, anatase (101) and
    rutile (100) have mostly molecular adsorption, while the simulations of
    rutile (110) sensitively depend on the slab thickness and molecular
    adsorption is preferred with thick slabs. Moreover, using an automated
    algorithm, we reveal that these surfaces follow different types of
    atomistic mechanisms for proton transfer and water dissociation: one-step,
    two- step, or both. These mechanisms can be rationalized based on the
    arrangements of water molecules on the different surfaces. Our finding thus
    demonstrates that the different pristine TiO2 surfaces react with water in
    distinct ways, and cannot be represented using just the low- energy anatase
    (101) and rutile (110) surfaces.
