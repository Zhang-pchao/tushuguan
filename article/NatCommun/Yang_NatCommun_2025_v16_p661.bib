    Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) significantly impact Earth's climate and
    human health. Although the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
    has been recognized as the major contributor to the atmospheric SOA budget,
    the mechanisms by which this process produces SOA-forming highly oxygenated
    organic molecules (HOMs) remain unclear. A major challenge is navigating
    the complex chemical landscape of these transformations, which traditional
    hypothesis-driven methods fail to thoroughly investigate. Here, we explore
    the oxidation of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene, a critical atmospheric
    biogenic VOC, using a novel reaction discovery approach based on molecular
    dynamics and state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques. Our approach
    successfully identifies all established reaction pathways of
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis, as well as discovers multiple
    novel species and pathways without relying on a priori chemical knowledge.
    In particular, we unveil a key branching point that leads to the rapid
    formation of alkoxy radicals, whose high and diverse reactivity help to
    explain hitherto unexplained oxidation pathways suggested by mass spectral
    peaks observed in {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis experiments. This
    branching point is likely prevalent across a variety of atmospheric VOCs
    and could be crucial in establishing the missing link to SOA-forming HOMs.
