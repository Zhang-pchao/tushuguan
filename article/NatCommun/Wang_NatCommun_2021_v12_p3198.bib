    The electroreduction of nitrogen to ammonia offers a promising alternative
    to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Unfortunately, the reaction
    suffers from low activity and selectivity, owing to competing hydrogen
    evolution and the poor accessibility of nitrogen to the electrocatalyst.
    Here, we report that deliberately triggering a salting-out effect in a
    highly concentrated electrolyte can simultaneously tackle the above
    challenges and achieve highly efficient ammonia synthesis. The solute ions
    exhibit strong affinity for the surrounding H2O molecules, forming a
    hydration shell and limiting their efficacy as both proton sources and
    solvents. This not only effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution but also
    ensures considerable nitrogen flux at the reaction interface via
    heterogeneous nucleation of the precipitate, thus facilitating the
    subsequent reduction process in terms of both selectivity and activity. As
    expected, even when assembled with a metal-free electrocatalyst, a high
    Faradaic efficiency of 71{\,}{\ensuremath{\pm}}{\,}1.9{\%} is achieved with
    this proof-of-concept system.
