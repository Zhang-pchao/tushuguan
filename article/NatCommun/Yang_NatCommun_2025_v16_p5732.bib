    To adapt fluctuating renewable energy for water splitting is challenging,
    since the growth of electrochemically generated nanobubbles at early stage
    requires high supersaturation during the repeated start-stop cycles, which
    can accelerate the deactivation of electrodes and cause extra energy
    consumption. Herein, we propose a {''}bubble seeding{''} strategy by
    introducing nanobubbles (NBs, {\textasciitilde}200{\,}nm in diameter) into
    electrolyte to promote the generation of macroscopic bubbles. The
    precursive nanobubbles can act as the beforehand nuclei with a certain
    supersaturation, lower the supersaturation barrier for further growth, and
    result in reduced overpotential as high as 130{\,}mV for oxygen evolution
    reaction. The enhancement depends on nanobubble coverage and size, with
    higher coverage and larger sizes favoring macrobubble growth. The
    nanobubbles with inert gas species (e.g. N2 for oxygen evolution reaction)
    can also work as the seeds, while the interfering or consumable gas species
    (e.g. O2 for hydrogen evolution reaction) would hinder the generation of
    macroscopic bubbles and enlarge the overpotential. The water splitting
    device working at presence of nanobubbles exhibits stable operation voltage
    during repeated start-stop cycles in contrast to traditional electrolyte
    without NBs, indicating great potential of such traceless nanobubble
    additive strategy for stabilizing gas evolution applications.
