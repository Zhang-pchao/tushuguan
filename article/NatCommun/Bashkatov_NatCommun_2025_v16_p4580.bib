    Electrolytically generated gas bubbles can significantly hamper the overall
    electrolysis efficiency. Therefore it is crucial to understand their
    dynamics in order to optimise water electrolyzer systems. Herein, we
    elucidate a distinct transport mechanism whereby electrolyte droplets are
    sprayed into H2 bubbles. These droplets arise from the fragmentation of the
    Worthington jet, which is engendered by the coalescence with microbubbles.
    The robustness of this phenomenon is corroborated under both normal and
    microgravity conditions. Reminiscent of bursting bubbles on a liquid-gas
    interface, electrolyte spraying results in a flow inside the bubble. This
    flow couples, in an intriguing way, with the thermocapillary convection at
    the bubble's surface, clearly underlining the high interfacial mobility. In
    the case of electrode-attached bubbles, the sprayed droplets form
    electrolyte puddles affecting the dynamics near the three-phase contact
    line and favoring bubble detachment from the electrode. The results of this
    work unravel important insights into the physico- chemical aspects of
    electrolytic gas bubbles, integral for optimizing gas-evolving
    electrochemical systems.
