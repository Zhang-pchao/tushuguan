    Ammonia is of emerging interest as a liquefied, renewable-energy- sourced
    energy carrier for global use in the future. Electrochemical reduction of
    N2 (NRR) is widely recognised as an alternative to the traditional
    Haber-Bosch production process for ammonia. However, though the challenges
    of NRR experiments have become better understood, the reported rates are
    often too low to be convincing that reduction of the highly unreactive N2
    molecule has actually been achieved. This perspective critically reassesses
    a wide range of the NRR reports, describes experimental case studies of
    potential origins of false-positives, and presents an updated, simplified
    experimental protocol dealing with the recently emerging issues.
