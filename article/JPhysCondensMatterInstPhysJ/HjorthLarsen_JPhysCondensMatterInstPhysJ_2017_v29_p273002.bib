    The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in
    the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and
    analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in
    Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library
    make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a
    sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple
    'for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other
    quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic
    structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this
    calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard
    simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics,
    handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.
