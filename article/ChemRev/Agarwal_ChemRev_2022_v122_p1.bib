    We present an update and revision to our 2010 review on the topic of
    proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reagent thermochemistry. Over the
    past decade, the data and thermochemical formalisms presented in that
    review have been of value to multiple fields. Concurrently, there have been
    advances in the thermochemical cycles and experimental methods used to
    measure these values. This Review (i) summarizes those advancements, (ii)
    corrects systematic errors in our prior review that shifted many of the
    absolute values in the tabulated data, (iii) provides updated tables of
    thermochemical values, and (iv) discusses new conclusions and opportunities
    from the assembled data and associated techniques. We advocate for updated
    thermochemical cycles that provide greater clarity and reduce experimental
    barriers to the calculation and measurement of Gibbs free energies for the
    conversion of X to XHn in PCET reactions. In particular, we demonstrate the
    utility and generality of reporting potentials of hydrogenation,
    E{\textdegree}(V vs H2), in almost any solvent and how these values are
    connected to more widely reported bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs).
    The tabulated data demonstrate that E{\textdegree}(V vs H2) and BDFEs are
    generally insensitive to the nature of the solvent and, in some cases, even
    to the phase (gas versus solution). This Review also presents introductions
    to several emerging fields in PCET thermochemistry to give readers windows
    into the diversity of research being performed. Some of the next frontiers
    in this rapidly growing field are coordination-induced bond weakening, PCET
    in novel solvent environments, and reactions at material interfaces.
