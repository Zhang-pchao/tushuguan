  abstract     = {
    Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM) are formed in the atmosphere via
    autoxidation involving peroxy radicals arising from volatile organic
    compounds (VOC). HOM condense on pre-existing particles and can be involved
    in new particle formation. HOM thus contribute to the formation of
    secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a significant and ubiquitous component of
    atmospheric aerosol known to affect the Earth's radiation balance. HOM were
    discovered only very recently, but the interest in these compounds has
    grown rapidly. In this Review, we define HOM and describe the currently
    available techniques for their identification/quantification, followed by a
    summary of the current knowledge on their formation mechanisms and
    physicochemical properties. A main aim is to provide a common frame for the
    currently quite fragmented literature on HOM studies. Finally, we highlight
    the existing gaps in our understanding and suggest directions for future
    HOM research.
