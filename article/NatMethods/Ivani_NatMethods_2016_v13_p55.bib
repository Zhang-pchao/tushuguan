    We present parmbsc1, a force field for DNA atomistic simulation, which has
    been parameterized from high-level quantum mechanical data and tested for
    nearly 100 systems (representing a total simulation time of
    {\ensuremath{\sim}} 140 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s) covering most of DNA
    structural space. Parmbsc1 provides high-quality results in diverse
    systems. Parameters and trajectories are available at
    http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/ParmBSC1/.
