    AbstractThe Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of
    Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied
    for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is
    presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for
    free{-}energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm
    possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently
    employed: (1) It provides a built{-}in estimate of sampling errors thereby
    yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of
    additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2)
    it yields the {\textquotedblleft}best{\textquotedblright} value of free
    energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the
    statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between
    simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions
    for obtaining better estimates of the free{-}energy differences. By
    recasting the Ferrenberg{\textendash}Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations
    in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have
    demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it
    to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile
    of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine.
