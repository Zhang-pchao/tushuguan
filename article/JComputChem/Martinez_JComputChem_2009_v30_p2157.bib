    Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist
    of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to
    approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the
    simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive
    interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise
    distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a
    packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints
    related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of
    different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have
    developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily
    complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The
    regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or
    boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each
    type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must
    satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in
    water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In
    addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be
    restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered
    molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc.
    The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies
    from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files
    are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy
    coordinate files. The package is distributed as free software and can be
    downloaded from
