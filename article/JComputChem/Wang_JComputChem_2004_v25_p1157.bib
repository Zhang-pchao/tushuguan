    We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules.
    GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for
    proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and
    pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and
    halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom
    types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate
    force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test
    cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were
    compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement
    of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25
    A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A,
    respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22
    nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular
    energies were compared to MP2/6-31G\textasteriskcentered results. The RMS
    of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol,
    respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A
    and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base
    pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs
    that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in
    relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can
    be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it
    suitable for rational drug design and database searching.
