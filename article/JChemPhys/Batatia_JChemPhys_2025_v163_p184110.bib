    Atomistic simulations of matter, especially those that leverage first-
    principles (ab{~}initio) electronic structure theory, provide a microscopic
    view of the world, underpinning much of our understanding of chemistry and
    materials science. Over the last decade or so, machine-learned force fields
    have transformed atomistic modeling by enabling simulations of ab{~}initio
    quality over unprecedented time and length scales. However, early
    machine-learning (ML) force fields have largely been limited by (i) the
    substantial computational and human effort required to develop and validate
    potentials for each particular system of interest and (ii) a general lack
    of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, we show that
    it is possible to create a general-purpose atomistic ML model, trained on a
    public dataset of moderate size, that is capable of running stable
    molecular dynamics for a wide range of molecules and materials. We
    demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model-and its qualitative and at
    times quantitative accuracy-on a diverse set of problems in the physical
    sciences, including properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical
    reactions, interfaces, and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model
    can be applied out of the box as a starting or {''}foundation{''} model for
    any atomistic system of interest and, when desired, can be fine-tuned on
    just a handful of application-specific data points to reach ab{~}initio
    accuracy. Establishing that a stable force-field model can cover almost all
    materials changes atomistic modeling in a fundamental way: experienced
    users obtain reliable results much faster, and beginners face a lower
    barrier to entry. Foundation models thus represent a step toward
    democratizing the revolution in atomic-scale modeling that has been brought
    about by ML force fields.
