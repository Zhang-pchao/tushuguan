    Aqueous solutions of alcohols are interesting because of their anomalous
    behavior that is believed to be due to the molecular structuring of water
    and alcohol around each other in solution. The interfacial structuring and
    properties are significant for application in alcohol purification
    processes and biomolecular structure. Here we study aqueous mixtures of
    short alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol) at a
    hydrophobic surface using interfacial statistical associating fluid theory
    which is a perturbation density functional theory. The addition of a small
    amount of alcohol decreases the interfacial tension of water drastically.
    This trend in interfacial tension can be explained by the structure of
    water and alcohol next to the surface. The hydrophobic group of an added
    alcohol preferentially goes to the surface preserving the structure of
    water in the bulk. For a given bulk alcohol concentration, water mixed with
    the different alcohols has different interfacial tensions with propanol
    having a lower interfacial tension than methanol and ethanol. 2-propanol is
    not as effective in decreasing the interfacial tension as 1-propanol
    because it partitions poorly to the surface due to its larger excluded
    volume. But for a given surface alcohol mole fraction, all the alcohol
    mixtures give similar values for interfacial tension. For separation of
    alcohol from water, methods that take advantage of the high surface mole
    fraction of alcohol have advantages compared to separation using the vapor
    in equilibrium with a water-alcohol liquid.
