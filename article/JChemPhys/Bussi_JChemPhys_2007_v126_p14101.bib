    The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the
    canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the
    particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is
    formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature,
    a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution.
    In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy
    of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method
    on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its
    performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat
    parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.
