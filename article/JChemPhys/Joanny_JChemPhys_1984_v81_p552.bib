    We discuss the behavior of a liquid partially wetting a solid surface, when
    the contact angle at equilibrium {\ensuremath{\theta}}0 is small, but
    finite. The solid is assumed to be either flat, but chemically
    heterogeneous (this in turn modulating the interfacial tensions), or rough.
    For weak heterogeneities, we expect no hysteresis, but the contact line
    becomes wiggly. For stronger heterogeneities, we first discuss the behavior
    of the contact line in the presence of a single, localized defect, and show
    that there may exist two stable positions for the line, obtained by a
    simple graphic construction. Hysteresis shows up when the strength of the
    defect is above a certain threshold. Extending this to a dilute system of
    defects, we obtain formulas for the
    {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}advancing{\textquoteright}{\textqu
    oteright} and {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}receding{\textquoteright
    }{\textquoteright} contact angles {\ensuremath{\theta}}a,
    {\ensuremath{\theta}}r, in terms of the distribution of defect strength and
    defect sharpness. These formulas might be tested by controlled
    contamination of a solid surface.
