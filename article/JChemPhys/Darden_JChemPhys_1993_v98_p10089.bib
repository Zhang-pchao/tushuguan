  abstract     = {
    An N{\ensuremath{\cdot}}log(N) method for evaluating electrostatic energies
    and forces of large periodic systems is presented. The method is based on
    interpolation of the reciprocal space Ewald sums and evaluation of the
    resulting convolutions using fast Fourier transforms. Timings and
    accuracies are presented for three large crystalline ionic systems.
