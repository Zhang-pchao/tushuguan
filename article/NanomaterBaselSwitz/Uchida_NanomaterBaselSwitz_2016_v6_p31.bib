    Micro- and nanobubbles (MNBs) are potentially useful for industrial
    applications such as the purification of wastewater and the promotion of
    physiological activities of living organisms. To develop such applications,
    we should understand their properties and behavior, such as their lifetime
    and their number density in solution. In the present study, we observed
    oxygen MNBs distributed in an electrolyte (NaCl) solution using a
    transmission electron microscope to analyze samples made with the
    freeze-fracture replica method. We found that MNBs in a 100 mM NaCl
    solution remain for at least 1 week, but at higher concentrations decay
    more quickly. To better understand their lifetimes, we compared
    measurements of the solution's dissolved oxygen concentration and the
    {\ensuremath{\zeta}}-potential of the MNBs. Our detailed observations of
    transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images allows us to conclude that
    low concentrations of NaCl stabilize MNBs due to the ion shielding effect.
    However, higher concentrations accelerate their disappearance by reducing
    the repulsive force between MNBs.
