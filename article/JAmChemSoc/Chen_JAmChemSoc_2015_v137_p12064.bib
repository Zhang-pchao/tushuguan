    Exploring the nucleation of gas bubbles at interfaces is of fundamental
    interest. Herein, we report the nucleation of individual N2 nanobubbles at
    Pt nanodisk electrodes (6{\textendash}90 nm) via the irreversible
    electrooxidation of hydrazine (N2H4 {\textrightarrow} N2 + 4H(+) +
    4e({\textendash})). The nucleation and growth of a stable N2 nanobubble at
    the Pt electrode is indicated by a sudden drop in voltammetric current, a
    consequence of restricted mass transport of N2H4 to the electrode surface
    following the liquid-to-gas phase transition. The critical surface
    concentration of dissolved N2 required for nanobubble nucleation,
    CN2,critical(s), obtained from the faradaic current at the moment just
    prior to bubble formation, is measured to be {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.11 M and
    is independent of the electrode radius and the bulk N2H4 concentration. Our
    results suggest that the size of stable gas bubble nuclei depends only on
    the local concentration of N2 near the electrode surface, consistent with
    previously reported studies of the electrogeneration of H2 nanobubbles.
    CN2,critical(s) is {\ensuremath{\sim}}160 times larger than the N2
    saturation concentration at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The
    residual current for N2H4 oxidation after formation of a stable N2
    nanobubble at the electrode surface is proportional to the N2H4
    concentration as well as the nanoelectrode radius, indicating that the
    dynamic equilibrium required for the existence of a stable N2 nanobubble is
    determined by N2H4 electrooxidation at the three phase contact line.
