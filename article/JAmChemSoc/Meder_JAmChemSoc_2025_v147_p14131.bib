    The oxidation of monoterpenes is one of the largest single sources of
    atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) significantly impacting the
    climate and air quality. Still, the autoxidation mechanisms converting
    these volatile precursors to low-volatility condensable products remain
    elusive even for the most abundant monoterpene
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene. We studied the ozonolysis of
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene by combining advanced isotopic labeling and
    state-of-the-art chemical ionization mass spectrometry supported by quantum
    chemical calculations. We reacted a full set of eight selectively
    deuterated {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene analogues separately in a flow
    reactor to probe the oxidation mechanisms on a molecular level. We found
    that surprisingly few carbon atoms participate in the autoxidation process
    when forming even the most oxygenated products. Additionally, prompt
    pinonic acid formation has likely been greatly overestimated, whereas the
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene-derived dioxirane appears more stable than
    previously thought. Importantly, we reveal that oxidation models should
    include multiple branching pathways rather than simple linear autoxidation
    progression from less to more oxygenated species. Correct modeling of the
    oxidation is crucial to enable accurate predictions in the changing climate
    and atmospheric conditions.
