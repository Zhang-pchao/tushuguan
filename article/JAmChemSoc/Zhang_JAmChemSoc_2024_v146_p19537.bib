    It has been widely recognized that the pH environment influences the
    nanobubble dynamics and hydroxide ions adsorbed on the surface may be
    responsible for the long-term survival of the nanobubbles. However,
    understanding the distribution of hydronium and hydroxide ions in the
    vicinity of a bulk nanobubble surface at a microscopic scale and the
    consequent impact of these ions on the nanobubble behavior remains a
    challenging endeavor. In this study, we carried out deep potential
    molecular dynamics simulations to explore the behavior of a nitrogen
    nanobubble under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions and the inherent
    mechanism, and we also conducted a theoretical thermodynamic and dynamic
    analysis to address constraints related to simulation duration. Our
    simulations and theoretical analyses demonstrate a trend of nanobubble
    dissolution similar to that observed experimentally, emphasizing the
    limited dissolution of bulk nanobubbles in alkaline conditions, where
    hydroxide ions tend to reside slightly farther from the nanobubble surface
    than hydronium ions, forming more stable hydrogen bond networks that shield
    the nanobubble from dissolution. In acidic conditions, the hydronium ions
    preferentially accumulating at the nanobubble surface in an orderly manner
    drive nanobubble dissolution to increase the entropy of the system, and the
    dissolved nitrogen molecules further strengthen the hydrogen bond networks
    of systems by providing a hydrophobic environment for hydronium ions,
    suggesting both entropy and enthalpy effects contribute to the instability
    of nanobubbles under acidic conditions. These results offer fresh insights
    into the double-layer distribution of hydroxide and hydronium near the
    nitrogen-water interface that influences the dynamic behavior of bulk
    nanobubbles.
