    Ammonia (NH3) is an essential chemical in modern society. It is currently
    manufactured by the Haber-Bosch process using H2 and N2 under extremely
    high-pressure ({\ensuremath{>}}200 bar) and high- temperature
    ({\ensuremath{>}}673 K) conditions. Photocatalytic NH3 production from
    water and N2 at atmospheric pressure and room temperature is ideal. Several
    semiconductor photocatalysts have been proposed, but all suffer from low
    efficiency. Here we report that a commercially available TiO2 with a large
    number of surface oxygen vacancies, when photoirradiated by UV light in
    pure water with N2, successfully produces NH3. The active sites for N2
    reduction are the Ti3+ species on the oxygen vacancies. These species act
    as adsorption sites for N2 and trapping sites for the photoformed
    conduction band electrons. These properties therefore promote efficient
    reduction of N2 to NH3. The solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency
    is 0.02{\%}, which is the highest efficiency among the early reported
    photocatalytic systems. This noble-metal-free TiO2 system therefore shows a
    potential as a new artificial photosynthesis for green NH3 production.
