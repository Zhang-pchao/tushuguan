    The prompt formation of highly oxidized organic compounds in the ozonolysis
    of cyclohexene (C6H10) was investigated by means of laboratory experiments
    together with quantum chemical calculations. The experiments were performed
    in borosilicate glass flow tube reactors coupled to a chemical ionization
    atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a
    nitrate ion (NO3(-))-based ionization scheme. Quantum chemical calculations
    were performed at the CCSD(T)-F12a/VDZ-F12//{\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD/aug-
    cc-pVTZ level, with kinetic modeling using multiconformer transition state
    theory, including Eckart tunneling corrections. The complementary
    investigation methods gave a consistent picture of a formation mechanism
    advancing by peroxy radical (RO2) isomerization through intramolecular
    hydrogen shift reactions, followed by sequential O2 addition steps, that
    is, RO2 autoxidation, on a time scale of seconds. Dimerization of the
    peroxy radicals by recombination and cross-combination reactions is in
    competition with the formation of highly oxidized monomer species and is
    observed to lead to peroxides, potentially diacyl peroxides. The molar
    yield of these highly oxidized products (having O/C {\ensuremath{>}} 1 in
    monomers and O/C {\ensuremath{>}} 0.55 in dimers) from cyclohexene
    ozonolysis was determined as (4.5 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3.8){\%}. Fully
    deuterated cyclohexene and cis-6-nonenal ozonolysis, as well as the
    influence of water addition to the system (either H2O or D2O), were also
    investigated in order to strengthen the arguments on the proposed
    mechanism. Deuterated cyclohexene ozonolysis resulted in a less oxidized
    product distribution with a lower yield of highly oxygenated products and
    cis-6-nonenal ozonolysis generated the same monomer product distribution,
    consistent with the proposed mechanism and in agreement with quantum
    chemical modeling.
