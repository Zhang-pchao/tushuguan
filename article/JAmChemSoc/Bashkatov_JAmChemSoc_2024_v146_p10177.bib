    The evolution of electrogenerated gas bubbles during water electrolysis can
    significantly hamper the overall process efficiency. Promoting the
    departure of electrochemically generated bubbles during (water)
    electrolysis is therefore beneficial. For a single bubble, a departure from
    the electrode surface occurs when buoyancy wins over the downward-acting
    forces (e.g., contact, Marangoni, and electric forces). In this work, the
    dynamics of a pair of H2 bubbles produced during the hydrogen evolution
    reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4 using a dual platinum microelectrode system is
    systematically studied by varying the electrode distance and the cathodic
    potential. By combining high- speed imaging and electrochemical analysis,
    we demonstrate the importance of bubble-bubble interactions in the
    departure process. We show that bubble coalescence may lead to
    substantially earlier bubble departure as compared to buoyancy effects
    alone, resulting in considerably higher reaction rates at a constant
    potential. However, due to continued mass input and conservation of
    momentum, repeated coalescence events with bubbles close to the electrode
    may drive departed bubbles back to the surface beyond a critical current,
    which increases with the electrode spacing. The latter leads to the
    resumption of bubble growth near the electrode surface, followed by
    buoyancy-driven departure. While less favorable at small electrode spacing,
    this configuration proves to be very beneficial at larger separations,
    increasing the mean current up to 2.4 times compared to a single electrode
    under the conditions explored in this study.
