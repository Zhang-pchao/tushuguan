    Previous experiments have shown that when water is mixed with dissolvable
    organic molecules (DOMs), it can lead to insoluble gas- containing
    nanoclusters. However, molecular insights into the gas- containing
    nanoclusters are still lacking. Herein, we show the first large-scale
    simulation evidence of stable nanobubble (NB) clusters
    ({\ensuremath{\sim}}2 nm radius) of insoluble gas in water mixed with DOMs
    by using electrically neutral interface models. Notably, our molecular
    dynamics simulations demonstrate a dissolution-nanobubble- dissolution
    transition for the (insoluble) gas in the water/DOM solutions (as the mole
    fraction of DOMs is increased), a phenomenon observed across most DOM types
    excluding extreme polarity cases. The latter evidence suggests that the
    formation of gas-containing NB clusters is likely a generic phenomenon for
    water mixed with a modest amount of DOMs. The re-entrant dissolution
    behavior can be attributed to the dual roles of DOMs, i.e., for promoting
    and stabilizing NB clusters at low gas mole fraction and generating
    continuous nanostructures of the gas beyond the NB formation threshold. Our
    independent theoretical analysis confirms the stability of NB clusters in
    water/DOM solutions. Akin to micelle formation, NB formation results in
    increased solubility of insoluble gas in water/DOM solutions. From a
    fundamental solution chemistry perspective, the formation of NB clusters
    can be viewed as a nanoscale solvation mechanism that differs markedly from
    the conventional molecular solvation mechanism for the insoluble gas in
    water.
