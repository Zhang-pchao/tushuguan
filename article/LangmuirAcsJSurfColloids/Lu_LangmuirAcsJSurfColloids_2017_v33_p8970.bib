    Textured surfaces are instrumental in water repellency or fluid wicking
    applications, where the pinning and depinning of the liquid- gas interface
    plays an important role. Previous work showed that a contact line can
    exhibit nonuniform behavior due to heterogeneities in surface chemistry or
    roughness. We demonstrate that such nonuniformities can be achieved even
    without varying the local energy barrier. Around a cylindrical pillar, an
    interface can reside in an intermediate state where segments of the contact
    line are pinned to the pillar top while the rest of the contact line moves
    along the sidewall. This partially pinned mode is due to the global
    nonaxisymmetric pattern of the surface features and exists for all textured
    surfaces, especially when superhydrophobic surfaces are about to be flooded
    or when capillary wicks are close to dryout.
