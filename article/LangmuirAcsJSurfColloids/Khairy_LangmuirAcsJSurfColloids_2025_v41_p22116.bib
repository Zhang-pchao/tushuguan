    Nanobubbles (NBs) have recently emerged as a medium uniquely suitable for a
    wide range of science and engineering applications, yet their behavior
    under different solution conditions remains poorly understood. In this
    study, we conducted a systematic investigation of the characteristics and
    stability of nitrogen NBs in solutions of varying salinities and pH. NBs
    were examined by scanning electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking
    analysis, and zeta potential measurements. Optimal NB generation parameters
    (gas flow rate: 0.5 ft3/h; duration: 60 min) yielded NBs with high
    concentrations of (200 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 20) {\texttimes} 106 bubbles/mL,
    uniform sizes (100 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 20 nm), and zeta potential of -34.0
    {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.3 mV. Effects of salt (NaCl) concentration and pH were
    probed in two distinct scenarios: (1) direct generation of NBs in solutions
    with varying salinity or pH and (2) generating NBs in deionized water with
    subsequent addition of NaCl or pH adjustment. In the first scenario, NB
    generation at high salinity and high pH produced more concentrated NB
    solutions, rationalized by the salting- out effect and more negative NB
    surface charge at alkaline pH, respectively. However, despite the high
    initial concentrations, NBs formed at high salt exhibited very poor
    long-term stability, likely due to electric double layer (EDL) compression.
    Likewise, high pH proved less favorable for the NB stability over time than
    neutral, although generally more than the acidic pH. By contrast, salt
    addition postgeneration and pH adjustment in either direction led to a drop
    in the NB concentrations, more pronounced as the salinity increased or pH
    decreased. Similar to the first scenario, the long-term stability was also
    reduced by the added salt as well as acidic and, to a lesser extent, even
    basic pH. These findings provide important insights into optimizing the NB
    solutionsfor diverse applications, particularly for enhanced oil recovery,
    where stability under harsh salinity and pH conditions is essential.
