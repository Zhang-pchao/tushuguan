    Electrochemical gas evolution reactions are of vital importance in numerous
    electrochemical processes including water splitting, chloralkaline process,
    and fuel cells. During gas evolution reactions, gas bubbles are vigorously
    and constantly forming and influencing these processes. In the past few
    decades, extensive studies have been performed to understand the evolution
    of gas bubbles, elucidate the mechanisms of how gas bubbles impact gas
    evolution reactions, and exploit new bubble-based strategies to improve the
    efficiency of gas evolution reactions. In this feature article, we
    summarize the classical theories as well as recent advancements in this
    field and provide an outlook on future research topics.
