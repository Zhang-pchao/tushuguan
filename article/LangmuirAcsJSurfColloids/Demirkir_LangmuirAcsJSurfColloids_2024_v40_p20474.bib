    We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen
    bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode
    enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size.
    Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact
    angle and volume through solutions of the Young- Laplace equation. We
    observe bubbles without ({''}pinned bubbles{''}) and with ({''}spreading
    bubbles{''}) contact line spreading and find that the latter mode becomes
    more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is {\ensuremath{\geq}}0.1 M.
    The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed
    the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz [Phys. Z. 1935,
    36, 379-384] for this case. We show that this is related to the contact
    line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an
    initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode
    is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle
    reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the
    departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the
    experimental data.
