    The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) toward
    air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due
    to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of
    interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics
    simulations based on state-of- the-art neural network potentials with
    approximate M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and
    hydroxide ions at air/oil(decane)-water interfaces, which can
    simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these
    ions, the recombination of ions, and the ionic distribution along the
    normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi
    collective variables. A stable ionic double-layer distribution is observed
    near the air-water interface, while the distribution is different at
    oil-water interfaces, where hydronium tends to be repelled from the
    interface into the bulk water, whereas hydroxide, with an interfacial
    stabilization free energy of -0.6 kcal/mol, is enriched in the interfacial
    layer. Through simulations of oil droplets in water, we further reveal that
    the interfacial propensity of hydroxide ions is caused by the positive
    charge distribution of the oil-water interface contributed by hydrogens of
    the dangling OH bonds of the interfacial water layer and the outermost
    layer decane molecules lying flat on the droplet. The present results may
    aid in understanding the acid-base nature of water interfaces with wide
    applications.
