    In gas-oversaturated solutions, stable surface nanobubbles can exist thanks
    to a balance between the Laplace pressure and the gas overpressure,
    provided the contact line of the bubble is pinned. In this article, we
    analyze how the disjoining pressure originating from the van der Waals
    interactions of the liquid and the gas with the surface affects the
    properties of the surface nanobubbles. From a functional minimization of
    the Gibbs free energy in the sharp- interface approximation, we find the
    bubble shape that takes into account the attracting van der Waals potential
    and gas compressibility effects. Although the bubble shape slightly
    deviates from the classical one (defined by the Young contact angle), it
    preserves a nearly spherical-cap shape. We also find that the disjoining
    pressure restricts the aspect ratio (size/height) of the bubble and derive
    the maximal possible aspect ratio, which is expressed via the Young angle.
