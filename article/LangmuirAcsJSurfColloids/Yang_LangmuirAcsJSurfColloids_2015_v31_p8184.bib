    Bubble dynamics, including the formation, growth, and detachment, of single
    H2 bubbles was studied at a platinum microelectrode during the electrolysis
    of 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The bubbles were visualized through a microscope
    by a high-speed camera. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in
    parallel to measure the transient current. The periodic current
    oscillations, resulting from the periodic formation and detachment of
    single bubbles, allow the bubble lifetime and size to be predicted from the
    transient current. A comparison of the bubble volume calculated from the
    current and from the recorded bubble image shows a gas evolution efficiency
    increasing continuously with the growth of the bubble until it reaches
    100{\%}. Two different substrates, glass and epoxy, were used to embed the
    Pt wire. While nearly no difference was found with respect to the growth
    law for the bubble radius, the contact angle differs strongly for the two
    types of cell. Data provided for the contact point evolution further
    complete the image of single hydrogen bubble growth. Finally, the velocity
    field driven by the detached bubble was measured by means of PIV, and the
    effects of the convection on the subsequent bubble were evaluated.
