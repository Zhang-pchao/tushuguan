    Thermal response and solutal stability of bulk nanobubbles are critical for
    advancing their applications in food preservation and environmental
    remediation; herein, we investigated these properties through a combination
    of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Characteristics of
    nanobubbles on size distribution, number density, and zeta potential were
    examined over two cycles of freeze-thaw treatment. Nanobubble suspensions
    were generated through ultrasonic cavitation and subsequently subjected to
    freezing using either a conventional freezer or liquid nitrogen. To clarify
    how thermal and solutal factors affect nanobubbles, the ethanol-water
    mixtures with several ethanol volume fractions of 1 vol {\%}, 3 vol {\%}, 5
    vol {\%}, and 10 vol {\%} and saline water with 3.5 wt {\%} salt
    concentration were prepared. Both pure water and saline water exhibited a
    decrease in number density and zeta potential after two cycles, while
    nanobubbles considerably remained stable in ethanol suspensions. Moreover,
    rapid cooling significantly slowed the decline in bubble concentration over
    two cycles compared with slow cooling in pure and saline water. During the
    freezing and thawing of electrolyte solutions, concentration gradients
    develop in the bulk phase, inducing fluctuations in the formation and
    stability of nanobubbles. Experimental measurements, combined with
    molecular dynamics simulations, revealed that enhanced zeta potential and
    hydrogen- bonding networks of ethanol at the gas-liquid interface
    contribute to the stability of nanobubbles in the ethanol-water mixture.
    These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between
    solvent composition, thermal treatment, and interfacial structure, offering
    guidance for the design and control of nanobubbles in practical
    applications.
