    ConspectusClosed-loop cycling of green hydrogen is a promising alternative
    to the current hydrocarbon economy for mitigating the energy crisis and
    environmental pollution. It stores energy from renewable energy sources
    like solar, wind, and hydropower into the chemical bond of dihydrogen (H2)
    via (photo)electrochemical water splitting, and then the stored energy can
    be released on demand through the reverse reactions in H2-O2 fuel cells.
    The sluggish kinetics of the involved half-reactions like hydrogen
    evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen
    oxidation reaction (HOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limit its
    realization. Moreover, considering the local gas-liquid-solid triphase
    microenvironments during H2 generation and utilization, rapid mass
    transport and gas diffusion are critical as well. Accordingly, developing
    cost-effective and active electrocatalysts featuring three- dimensional
    hierarchically porous structures are highly desirable to promote the energy
    conversion efficiency. Traditionally, the synthetic approaches of porous
    materials include soft/hard templating, sol-gel, 3D printing, dealloying,
    and freeze-drying, which often need tedious procedures, high temperature,
    expensive equipment, and/or harsh physiochemical conditions. In contrast,
    dynamic electrodeposition on bubbles using the in situ formed bubbles as
    templates can be conducted at ambient conditions with an electrochemical
    workstation. Moreover, the whole preparation process can be finished within
    minutes/hours, and the resulting porous materials can be employed as
    catalytic electrodes directly, avoiding the use of polymeric binders like
    Nafion and the consequent issues like limited catalyst loading, reduced
    conductivity, and inhibited mass transport.In this Account, we summarize
    our contributions to the dynamic electrodeposition on bubbles toward
    advanced porous electrocatalysts for green hydrogen cycling. These dynamic
    electrosynthesis strategies include potentiodynamic electrodeposition that
    linearly scans the applied potentials, galvanostatic electrodeposition that
    fixes the applied currents, and electroshock which quickly switches the
    applied potentials. The resulting porous electrocatalysts range from
    transition metals to alloys, nitrides, sulfides, phosphides, and their
    hybrids. We mainly focus on the 3D porosity design of the electrocatalysts
    by tuning the electrosynthesis parameters to tailor the behaviors of bubble
    co-generation and thus the reaction interface. Then, their electrocatalytic
    applications for HER, OER, overall water splitting (OWS), biomass oxidation
    (to replace OER), and HOR are introduced, with a special emphasis on the
    porosity-promoted activity. Finally, the remaining challenges and future
    perspective are also discussed. We hope this Account will encourage more
    efforts into this attractive research field of dynamic electrodeposition on
    bubbles for various energy catalytic reactions like carbon dioxide/monoxide
    reduction, nitrate reduction, methane oxidation, chlorine evolution, and
    others.
