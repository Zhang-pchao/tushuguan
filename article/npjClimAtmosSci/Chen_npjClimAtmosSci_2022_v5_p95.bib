    AbstractSecondary organic aerosol (SOA) plays a significant role in
    contributing to atmospheric fine particles, as well as in global air
    quality and climate. However, the current understanding of the atmospheric
    formation of SOA and its simulation is still highly uncertain due to the
    complexity of its precursor VOCs. In our study, SOA formation in different
    mixed VOC scenarios was investigated using a 30{\,}m3 indoor smog chamber.
    By comparing SOA formation in individual VOC scenarios, it was found that
    SOA yield from anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs) can be positively (+83.9{\%})
    affected by coexisting AVOCs, while inhibited ({\ensuremath{-}}51.4{\%}) by
    the presence of isoprene, via the OH scavenging effect. The cross-
    reactions of peroxyl radical (RO2) generated from different AVOCs were
    proved to be the main contributor (up to 39.0{\%}) to SOA formation,
    highlighting the importance of RO2{\,}+{\,}R'O2 reactions in mixed VOC
    scenarios. Meanwhile, the formation of gas-phase organic intermediates of
    different volatility categories from the RO2 reactions was also affected by
    the precursor concentration, and a higher SOA yield was found at lower
    precursor concentrations due to the larger contribution of intermediates
    with lower volatility. Our study provides new insights into SOA formation
    by considering the interactions between intermediate products from mixed
    VOCs.
