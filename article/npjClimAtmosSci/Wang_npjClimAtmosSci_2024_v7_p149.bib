    Organic compounds released from wildfires and residential biomass burning
    play a crucial role in shaping the composition of the atmosphere. The
    solubility and subsequent reactions of these compounds in the aqueous phase
    of clouds and fog remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, these compounds
    have the potential to become an important source of secondary organic
    aerosol (SOA). In this study, we simulated the aqueous SOA (aqSOA) from
    residential wood burning emissions under atmospherically relevant
    conditions of gas-liquid phase partitioning, using a wetted-wall flow
    reactor (WFR). We analyzed and quantified the specific compounds present in
    these emissions at a molecular level and determined their solubility in
    clouds. Our findings reveal that while 1{\%} of organic compounds are fully
    water-soluble, 19{\%} exhibit moderate solubility and can partition into
    the aqueous phase in a thick cloud. Furthermore, it is found that the aqSOA
    generated in our laboratory experiments has a substantial fraction being
    attributed to the formation of oligomers in the aqueous phase. We also
    determined an aqSOA yield of 20{\%} from residential wood combustion, which
    surpasses current estimates based on gas-phase oxidation. These results
    indicate that in-cloud chemistry of organic gases emitted from wood burning
    can serve as an efficient pathway to produce organic aerosols, thus
    potentially influencing climate and air quality.
