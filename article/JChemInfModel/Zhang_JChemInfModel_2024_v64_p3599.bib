    Understanding tautomerism and characterizing solvent effects on the dynamic
    processes pose significant challenges. Using enhanced-sampling molecular
    dynamics based on state-of-the-art deep learning potentials, we
    investigated the tautomeric equilibria of glycine in water. We observed
    that the tautomerism between neutral and zwitterionic glycine can occur
    through both intramolecular and intermolecular proton transfers. The latter
    proceeds involving a contact anionic-glycine- hydronium ion pair or
    separate cationic-glycine-hydroxide ion pair. These pathways with
    comparable barriers contribute almost equally to the reaction flux.
