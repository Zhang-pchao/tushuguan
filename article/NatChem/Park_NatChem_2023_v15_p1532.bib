    Understanding and manipulating gas bubble evolution during electrochemical
    water splitting is a crucial strategy for optimizing the
    electrode/electrolyte/gas bubble interface. Here gas bubble dynamics are
    investigated during the hydrogen evolution reaction on a well-defined
    platinum microelectrode by varying the electrolyte composition. We find
    that the microbubble coalescence efficiency follows the Hofmeister series
    of anions in the electrolyte. This dependency yields very different types
    of H2 gas bubble evolution in different electrolytes, ranging from periodic
    detachment of a single H2 gas bubble in sulfuric acid to aperiodic
    detachment of small H2 gas bubbles in perchloric acid. Our results indicate
    that the solutal Marangoni convection, induced by the anion concentration
    gradient developing during the reaction, plays a critical role at practical
    current density conditions. The resulting Marangoni force on the H2 gas
    bubble and the bubble departure diameter therefore depend on how surface
    tension varies with concentration for different electrolytes. This insight
    provides new avenues for controlling bubble dynamics during electrochemical
    gas bubble formation.
