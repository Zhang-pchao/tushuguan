    Computational methods have been extended recently to allow for the presence
    of moving contact lines in simulated two-phase flows. The predictive
    capability offered by these methods is potentially large, joining
    theoretical and experimental methods. Several challenges rather unique to
    this area need to be overcome, however, notably regarding the conditions
    near a moving contact line and the very large separation of length scales
    in these flows. We first summarize the main models for moving contact lines
    and follow with an overview of computational methods that includes direct
    continuum approaches and macroscale models that resolve only the
    large-scale flow by modeling the effects of the conditions near the contact
    line using theory. Results are presented for contact-line motion on ideal
    as well as patterned and grooved surfaces and for extensions to account for
    complexities such as thermocapillarity and phase change.
