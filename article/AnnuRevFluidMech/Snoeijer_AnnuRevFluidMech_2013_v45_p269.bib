    The speed at which a liquid can move over a solid surface is strongly
    limited when a three-phase contact line is present, separating wet from dry
    regions. When enforcing large contact line speeds, this leads to the
    entrainment of drops, films, or air bubbles. In this review, we discuss
    experimental and theoretical progress revealing the physical mechanisms
    behind these dynamical wetting transitions. In this context, we discuss
    microscopic processes that have been proposed to resolve the
    moving{\textendash}contact line paradox and identify the different
    dynamical regimes of contact line motion.
