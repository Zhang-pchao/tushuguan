    The efficiency of water electrolysis is significantly impacted by the
    generation of micro- and nanobubbles on the electrodes. Here molecular
    dynamics simulations are used to investigate the dynamics of single
    electrolytic nanobubbles on nanoelectrodes. The simulations reveal that,
    depending on the value of current, nucleated nanobubbles either grow to an
    equilibrium state or grow unlimitedly and then detach. To account for these
    findings, the stability theory for surface nanobubbles is generalized by
    incorporating the electrolytic gas influx at the nanobubble's contact line
    and adopting a real gas law, leading to accurate predictions for the
    numerically observed transient growth and stationary states of the
    nanobubbles. With this theory, the minimum current for bubble detachment
    can also be derived analytically. In the detachment regime, the radius of
    the nanobubble first increases with time (t) as {\$}R{\textbackslash}propto
    t{\textasciicircum}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$} and then as {\$}R{\textbackslash}propto
    t{\textasciicircum}{\{}1/3{\}}{\$} , up to bubble detachment.
