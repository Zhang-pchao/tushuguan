    The interface shape near a moving contact line is described by the
    Cox{\textendash}Voinov theory, which contains a constant term that is not
    trivially obtained. In this work, an approximate expression of this term in
    explicit form is derived under the condition of a Navier slip. Introducing
    the approximation of a local slippery wedge flow, we first propose a novel
    form of the generalised lubrication equation. A matched asymptotic analysis
    of this equation yields the Cox{\textendash}Voinov relation with the
    constant term expressed in elementary functions. For various viscosity
    ratios and contact angles, the theoretical predictions are rigorously
    validated against full numerical solutions of the Stokes equations and
    available asymptotic results.
