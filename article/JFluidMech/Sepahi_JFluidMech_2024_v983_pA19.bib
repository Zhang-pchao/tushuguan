    Direct numerical simulations are utilised to investigate mass-transfer
    processes at gas-evolving electrodes that experience successive formation
    and detachment of bubbles. The gas{\textendash}liquid interface is modelled
    employing an immersed boundary method. We simulate the growth phase of the
    bubbles followed by their departure from the electrode surface in order to
    study the mixing induced by these processes. We find that the growth of the
    bubbles switches from a diffusion-limited mode at low to moderate
    fractional bubble coverages of the electrode to a reaction-limited growth
    dynamics at high coverages. Furthermore, our results indicate that the net
    transport within the system is governed by the effective buoyancy driving
    induced by the rising bubbles and that mechanisms commonly subsumed under
    the term {\textquoteleft}microconvection{\textquoteright} do not
    significantly affect the mass transport. Consequently, the resulting gas
    transport for different bubble sizes, current densities and electrode
    coverages can be collapsed onto one single curve and only depends on an
    effective Grashof number. The same holds for the mixing of the electrolyte
    when additionally taking the effect of surface blockage by attached bubbles
    into account. For the gas transport to the bubble, we find that the
    relevant Sherwood numbers also collapse onto a single curve when accounting
    for the driving force of bubble growth, incorporated in an effective Jakob
    number. Finally, linking the hydrogen transfer rates at the electrode and
    the bubble interface, an approximate correlation for the gas-evolution
    efficiency has been established. Taken together, these findings enable us
    to deduce parametrisations for all response parameters of the systems.
