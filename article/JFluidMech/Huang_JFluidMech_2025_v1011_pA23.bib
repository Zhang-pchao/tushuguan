    In gas evolving electrolysis, bubbles grow at electrodes due to a diffusive
    influx from oversaturation generated locally in the electrolyte by the
    electrode reaction. When considering electrodes of micrometre size
    resembling catalytic islands, direct numerical simulations show that
    bubbles may approach dynamic equilibrium states at which they neither grow
    nor shrink. These are found in under- and saturated bulk electrolytes
    during both pinning and expanding wetting regimes of the bubbles. The
    equilibrium is based on the balance of local influx near the bubble foot
    and global outflux. To identify the parameter regions of bubble growth,
    dissolution and dynamic equilibrium by analytical means, we extend the
    solution of Zhang {\&}amp; Lohse (2023) J. Fluid Mech.975, R3, by taking
    into account modified gas fluxes across the bubble interface, that result
    from a non-uniform distribution of dissolved gas. The Damk{\"o}hler numbers
    at equilibrium are found to range from small to intermediate values. Unlike
    pinned nano-bubbles studied earlier, for micrometre-sized bubbles the
    Laplace pressure plays only a minor role. With respect to the stability of
    the dynamic equilibrium states, we extend the methodology of Lohse {\&}amp;
    Zhang (2015a) Phys. Rev. E91 (3), 031003(R), by additionally taking into
    account the electrode reaction. Under contact line pinning, the equilibrium
    states are found to be stable for flat nano-bubbles and for micro-bubbles
    in general. For unpinned bubbles, the equilibrium states are always stable.
    Finally, we draw conclusions on how to possibly enhance the efficiency of
    electrolysis.
