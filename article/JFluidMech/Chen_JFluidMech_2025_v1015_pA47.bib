    The nucleation of bubbles on rough substrates has been widely investigated
    in various applications such as electrolysis processes and fluid
    transportation in pipelines. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying
    surface bubble nucleation are not fully understood. Using molecular
    dynamics simulations, we evaluate the probability of surface bubble
    nucleation, quantified by the magnitude of the nucleation threshold. Bubble
    nucleation preferentially occurs at the solid interfaces containing
    nanoscale defects or wells (nanowells), where reduced nucleation thresholds
    are observed. For the gas-entrapped nanowell, as the nanowell width
    decreases, the threshold of bubble nucleation around the nanowell gradually
    increases, eventually approaching a critical value close to that of a
    smooth surface. This results from a decrease in the amount of entrapped gas
    that promotes bubble nucleation, and the entrapped gas eventually converges
    to a critical state as the width decreases. For the liquid- filled
    nanowell, bubble nucleation initiates from the inner corner of the large
    nanowell. As the nanowell width decreases, the threshold is first kept
    constant and then decreases. This results from a decrease in the amount of
    filled liquid that inhibits bubble nucleation and from the enhanced
    confinement effect of the inner wall on the filled liquid as the width
    decreases. In this work, we propose a multiscale model integrating
    classical nucleation theory, van der Waals fluid theory and statistical
    mechanics to describe the relationship between nucleation threshold and
    nanowell width. Eventually, a unified phase diagram of bubble nucleation at
    the rough interface is summarised, offering fundamental insights for
    integrated system design.
