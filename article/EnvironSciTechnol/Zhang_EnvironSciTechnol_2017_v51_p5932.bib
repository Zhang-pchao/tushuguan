    Highly oxygenated multifunctional organic compounds (HOMs) originating from
    biogenic emissions constitute a widespread source of organic aerosols in
    the pristine atmosphere. However, the molecular forms in which HOMs are
    present in the condensed phase upon gas-particle partitioning remain
    unclear. In this study, we show that highly oxygenated molecules that
    contain multiple peroxide functionalities are readily cationized by the
    attachment of Na+ during electrospray ionization operated in the positive
    ion mode. With this method, we present the first identification of HOMs
    characterized as C8-10H12-18O4-9 monomers and C16-20H24-36O8-14 dimers in
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA).
    Simultaneous detection of these molecules in the gas phase provides direct
    evidence for their gas-to-particle conversion. Molecular properties of
    particulate HOMs generated from ozonolysis and OH oxidation of
    unsubstituted (C10H16) and deuterated (C10H13D3)
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene are investigated using coupled ion mobility
    spectrometry with mass spectrometry. The systematic shift in the mass of
    monomers in the deuterated system is consistent with the decomposition of
    isomeric vinylhydroperoxides to release vinoxy radical isotopologues, the
    precursors to a sequence of autoxidation reactions that ultimately yield
    HOMs in the gas phase. The remarkable difference observed in the dimer
    abundance under O3- versus OH- dominant environments underlines the
    competition between intramolecular hydrogen migration of peroxy radicals
    and their bimolecular termination reactions. Our results provide new and
    direct molecular-level information for a key component needed for achieving
    carbon mass closure of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene SOA.
