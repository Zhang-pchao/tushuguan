    A key mechanism for atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation
    occurs when oxidation products of volatile organic compounds condense onto
    pre-existing particles. Here, we examine effects of aerosol liquid water
    (ALW) on relative SOA yield and composition from
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis and the photooxidation of toluene
    and acetylene by OH. Reactions were conducted in a room- temperature flow
    tube under low-NOx conditions in the presence of equivalent loadings of
    deliquesced ({\ensuremath{\sim}}20 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g m-3 ALW) or
    effloresced ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}g m-3 ALW) ammonium
    sulfate seeds at exactly the same relative humidity (RH = 70{\%}) and state
    of wall conditioning. We found 13{\%} and 19{\%} enhancements in relative
    SOA yield for the {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene and toluene systems,
    respectively, when seeds were deliquesced rather than effloresced. The
    relative yield doubled in the acetylene system, and this enhancement was
    partially reversible upon drying the prepared SOA, which reduced the yield
    by 40{\%} within a time scale of seconds. We attribute the high relative
    yield of acetylene SOA on deliquesced seeds to aqueous partitioning and
    particle-phase reactions of the photooxidation product glyoxal. The
    observed range of relative yields for {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene,
    toluene, and acetylene SOA on deliquesced and effloresced seeds suggests
    that ALW plays a complicated, system-dependent role in SOA formation.
