    TiO2 is a widely used photocatalyst in science and technology and its
    interface with water is important in fields ranging from geochemistry to
    biomedicine. Yet, it is still unclear whether water adsorbs in molecular or
    dissociated form on TiO2 even for the case of well- defined crystalline
    surfaces. To address this issue, we simulated the TiO2-water interface
    using molecular dynamics with an ab initio-based deep neural network
    potential. Our simulations show a dynamical equilibrium of molecular and
    dissociative adsorption of water on TiO2. Water dissociates through a
    solvent-assisted concerted proton transfer to form a pair of short-lived
    hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface. Molecular adsorption of water is
    {\ensuremath{\Delta}}F = 8.0 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.9 kJ mol-1 lower in free
    energy than the dissociative adsorption, giving rise to a 5.6
    {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5{\%} equilibrium water dissociation fraction at room
    temperature. Due to the relevance of surface hydroxyl groups to the surface
    chemistry of TiO2, our model might be key to understanding phenomena
    ranging from surface functionalization to photocatalytic mechanisms.
