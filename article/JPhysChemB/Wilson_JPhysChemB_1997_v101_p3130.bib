    The free energy profiles of methanol and ethanol at the water liquid- vapor
    interface at 310K were calculated using molecular dynamics computer
    simulations. Both alcohols exhibit a pronounced free energy minimum at the
    interface and, therefore, have positive adsorption at this interface. The
    surface excess was computed from the Gibbs adsorption isotherm and was
    found to be in good agreement with experimental results. Neither compound
    exhibits a free energy barrier between the bulk and the surface adsorbed
    state. Scattering calculations of ethanol molecules from a gas phase
    thermal distribution indicate that the mass accommodation coefficient is
    0.98, and the molecules become thermalized within 10 ps of striking the
    interface. It was determined that the formation of the solvation structure
    around the ethanol molecule at the interface is not the rate-determining
    step in its uptake into water droplets. The motion of an ethanol molecule
    in a water lamella was followed for 30 ns. The time evolution of the
    probability distribution of finding an ethanol molecule that was initially
    located at the interface is very well described by the diffusion equation
    on the free energy surface.
