    Abstract. Highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) from
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis have been shown to be significant
    contributors to secondary organic aerosol (SOA), yet our mechanistic
    understanding of how the peroxy-radical-driven autoxidation leads to their
    formation in this system is still limited. The involved isomerisation
    reactions such as H-atom abstractions followed by O2 additions can take
    place on sub-second timescales in short-lived intermediates, making the
    process challenging to study. Similarly, while the end-products and
    sometimes radical intermediates can be observed using mass spectrometry,
    their structures remain elusive. Therefore, we propose a method utilising
    selective deuterations for unveiling the mechanisms of autoxidation, where
    the HOM products can be used to infer which C atoms have taken part in the
    isomerisation reactions. This relies on the fact that if a
    C{\ensuremath{-}}D bond is broken due to an abstraction by a peroxy group
    forming a {\ensuremath{-}}OOD hydroperoxide, the D atom will become labile
    and able to be exchanged with a hydrogen atom in water vapour (H2O),
    effectively leading to loss of the D atom from the molecule. In this study,
    we test the applicability of this method using three differently deuterated
    versions of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene with the newly developed chemical
    ionisation Orbitrap (CI-Orbitrap) mass spectrometer to inspect the
    oxidation products. The high mass-resolving power of the Orbitrap is
    critical, as it allows the unambiguous separation of molecules with a D
    atom (mD=2.0141) from those with two H atoms (mH2=2.0157). We found that
    the method worked well, and we could deduce that two of the three tested
    compounds had lost D atoms during oxidation, suggesting that those
    deuterated positions were actively involved in the autoxidation process.
    Surprisingly, the deuterations were not observed to decrease HOM molar
    yields, as would have been expected due to kinetic isotope effects. This
    may be an indication that the relevant H (or D) abstractions were fast
    enough that no competing pathways were of relevance despite slower
    abstraction rates of the D atom. We show that selective deuteration can be
    a very useful method for studying autoxidation on a molecular level and
    likely is not limited to the system of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene
    ozonolysis tested here.
