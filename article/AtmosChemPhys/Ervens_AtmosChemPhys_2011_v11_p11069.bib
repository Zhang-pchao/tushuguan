    Abstract. Progress has been made over the past decade in predicting
    secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass in the atmosphere using vapor
    pressure-driven partitioning, which implies that SOA compounds are formed
    in the gas phase and then partition to an organic phase (gasSOA). However,
    discrepancies in predicting organic aerosol oxidation state, size and
    product (molecular mass) distribution, relative humidity (RH) dependence,
    color, and vertical profile suggest that additional SOA sources and aging
    processes may be important. The formation of SOA in cloud and aerosol water
    (aqSOA) is not considered in these models even though water is an abundant
    medium for atmospheric chemistry and such chemistry can form dicarboxylic
    acids and {''}humic-like substances{''} (oligomers, high-molecular-weight
    compounds), i.e. compounds that do not have any gas phase sources but
    comprise a significant fraction of the total SOA mass. There is direct
    evidence from field observations and laboratory studies that organic
    aerosol is formed in cloud and aerosol water, contributing substantial mass
    to the droplet mode.  This review summarizes the current knowledge on
    aqueous phase organic reactions and combines evidence that points to a
    significant role of aqSOA formation in the atmosphere. Model studies are
    discussed that explore the importance of aqSOA formation and suggestions
    for model improvements are made based on the comprehensive set of
    laboratory data presented here. A first comparison is made between aqSOA
    and gasSOA yields and mass predictions for selected conditions. These
    simulations suggest that aqSOA might contribute almost as much mass as
    gasSOA to the SOA budget, with highest contributions from biogenic
    emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of
    anthropogenic pollutants (i.e. NOx) at high relative humidity and
    cloudiness. Gaps in the current understanding of aqSOA processes are
    discussed and further studies (laboratory, field, model) are outlined to
    complement current data sets.
