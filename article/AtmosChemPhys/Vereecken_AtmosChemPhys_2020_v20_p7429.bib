    Abstract. A large data set of rate coefficients for H{~}migration in peroxy
    radicals is presented and supplemented with literature data to derive a
    structure{\textendash}activity relationship (SAR) for the title reaction
    class. The SAR supports aliphatic RO2 radicals; unsaturated bonds and
    {\ensuremath{\beta}}-oxo substitutions both endocyclic and exocyclic to the
    transition state ring; and {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-oxo (aldehyde),
    {\textendash}OH, {\textendash}OOH, and {\textendash}ONO2 substitutions,
    including migration of O-based hydrogen atoms. Also discussed are
    {\textendash}C(=O)OH and {\textendash}OR substitutions. The SAR allows
    predictions of rate coefficients k(T) for a temperature range of 200 to
    450{\,}K, with migrations spans ranging from 1,4 to 1,9-H{~}shifts
    depending on the functionalities. The performance of the SAR reflects the
    uncertainty of the underlying data, reproducing the scarce experimental
    data on average to a factor of 2 and the wide range of theoretical data to
    a factor of 10 to 100, depending also on the quality of the data. The SAR
    evaluation discusses the performance in multi-functionalized species. For
    aliphatic RO2, we also present some experimental product identification
    that validates the expected mechanisms. The proposed SAR is a valuable tool
    for mechanism development and experimental design and guides future
    theoretical work, which should allow for rapid improvements of the SAR in
    the future. Relative multi-conformer transition state theory (rel-MC-TST)
    kinetic theory is introduced as an aid for systematic kinetic studies.
