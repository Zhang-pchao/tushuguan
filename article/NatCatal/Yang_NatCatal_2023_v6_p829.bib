    Ammonia decomposition on lithium imide surfaces has been intensively
    investigated owing to its potential role in a sustainable hydrogen- based
    economy. Here, through advanced molecular dynamics simulations of ab initio
    accuracy, we show that the surface structure of the catalyst changes on
    exposure to the reactants and a dynamic state is activated. It is this
    highly fluctuating state that is responsible for catalysis and not a
    well-defined static catalytic centre. In this activated environment, a
    series of reactions that eventually leads to the release of N{\_}2 and
    H{\_}2 molecules becomes possible. Once the flow of reagent is terminated,
    the imide surface returns to its pristine state. We suggest that by
    properly engineering this dynamic interfacial state one can design improved
    catalytic systems. The common static description of catalysts during
    turnover has often been challenged, but their specific nature under such
    conditions remains elusive. Now complex simulations reveal that ammonia
    decomposition on LiNH surfaces is catalysed by a highly dynamic,
    liquid-like interface that reversibly forms under operation.
