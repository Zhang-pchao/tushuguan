    We introduce an enhanced sampling algorithm to obtain converged free energy
    landscapes of molecular rare events, even when the collective variable (CV)
    used for biasing is not optimal. Our approach samples a time-dependent
    target distribution by combining the on-the-fly probability enhanced
    sampling and its exploratory variant, OPES Explore. This promotes more
    transitions between the relevant metastable states and accelerates the
    convergence speed of the free energy estimate. We demonstrate the
    successful application of this combined algorithm on the two-dimensional
    Wolfe-Quapp potential, millisecond time-scale ligand-receptor binding in
    the trypsin- benzamidine complex, and folding-unfolding transitions in
    chignolin mini-protein. Our proposed algorithm can compute accurate free
    energies at an affordable computational cost and is robust in terms of the
    choice of CVs, making it particularly promising for the simulation of
    complex biomolecular systems.
