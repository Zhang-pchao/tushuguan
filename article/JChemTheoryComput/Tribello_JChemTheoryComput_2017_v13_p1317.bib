    In this paper a set of computational tools for identifying the phases
    contained in a system composed of atoms or molecules is introduced. The
    method is rooted in graph theory and combines atom centered symmetry
    functions, adjacency matrices, and clustering algorithms to identify
    regions of space where the properties of the system constituents can be
    considered uniform. We show how this method can be used to define
    collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to
    enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can
    be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it
    to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and
    simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy. The semiconducting
    alloy example we discuss is particular challenging as multiple nucleation
    centers are formed. We show, however, that our algorithm is able to detect
    the grain boundaries in the resulting polycrystal.
