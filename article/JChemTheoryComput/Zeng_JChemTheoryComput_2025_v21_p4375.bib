    In recent years, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become
    indispensable tools in physics, chemistry, and materials science, driving
    the development of software packages for molecular dynamics (MD)
    simulations and related applications. These packages, typically built on
    specific machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX,
    face integration challenges when advanced applications demand communication
    across different frameworks. The previous TensorFlow-based implementation
    of the DeePMD-kit exemplified these limitations. In this work, we introduce
    DeePMD-kit version 3, a significant update featuring a multibackend
    framework that supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle
    backends, and demonstrate the versatility of this architecture through the
    integration of other MLP packages and of differentiable molecular force
    fields. This architecture allows seamless back-end switching with minimal
    modifications, enabling users and developers to integrate DeePMD-kit with
    other packages using different machine learning frameworks. This innovation
    facilitates the development of more complex and interoperable workflows,
    paving the way for broader applications of MLPs in scientific research.
