    Recently, much evidence has accumulated, showing that electric fields and
    water interfaces influence the characteristics and alignment of
    biomolecules and greatly boost reaction rates. The prototropic tautomerism
    is a fundamental process in biological systems; however, a comprehensive
    understanding of the electric field effects and interfacial effects on it
    is still lacking. In this work, we performed a theoretical study of the
    modulation of the electric field and the interface on the tautomerism
    dynamics of solvated glycine by using deep potential molecular dynamics
    technology with enhanced sampling. The deep learning potentials used were
    trained to integrate long-range electrostatic interactions in order to
    better describe the electric field effect. We observed that an external
    electric field of 10 mV/{\r{A}} barely changed the key structures involved
    in tautomerism reactions but significantly influenced their relative free
    energies and consequently made the transformation from zwitterionic ([Z])
    to neutral ([N]) glycine more achievable both thermodynamically and
    dynamically and altered the optimal reaction mechanism from intramolecular
    proton transfer (Intra-PT) to intermolecular proton transfer (Inter-PT)
    involving a separate cationic-glycine-hydroxide ion pair. The detailed
    analysis revealed that the electric field increased the thermodynamical
    stability of [N] relative to [Z] by 7 kJ/mol due to the entropy effect and
    promoted the Inter-PT pathway by electrostatically facilitating the
    separation of ion pairs, causing the free-energy-barrier decrease of the
    rate-determined step by approximately 10 kJ/mol. Interestingly, in the
    air-water interface, due to the interfacial propensity of the glycine and
    water self-ions, the separation of ion pairs is restricted, slowing the
    Inter-PT pathways. Nevertheless, the interfacial interconversion between
    the [Z] and [N] forms of glycine is dynamically accelerated via the Intra-
    PT pathway due to partial solvation. These findings provide new insights
    into how the electric field and interfaces modulate thermodynamics,
    kinetics, and the mechanism of chemical reactions.
