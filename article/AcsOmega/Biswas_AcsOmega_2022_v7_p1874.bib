    Synthesis of ammonia through electrochemical nitrogen reduction (ENR) is
    emerging as one of the attractive research areas in recent years,
    notwithstanding the enormous challenges it faces in quantification of
    ammonia at very low concentrations. Several reports claiming high
    production rate are unwittingly compromised by the accuracy of analyzing a
    very low concentration ({\ensuremath{<}}1 ppm) of ammonia in the
    electrolyte post-ENR reaction using the indophenol method. Therefore, in
    this work, we have highlighted the significance of selecting and
    standardizing a right protocol encompassing admissible levels of oxidants
    and a complexing agent, citrate (to mitigate the effect of interfering
    metal ions), through elaborate control experiments. In addition, the
    importance of setting the lowest limit of ammonia concentration that can be
    accurately quantified by the indophenol method is also justified. Further,
    the experimental observations were summarized into a protocol, which was
    followed to re-evaluate the performance of two well-claimed
    electrocatalysts for ENR reported recently in the literature.
