    Bubble behaviors play crucial roles in mass transfer and energy efficiency
    in gas evolution reactions. Combining multiscale structures and surface
    chemical compositions, micro-/nanostructured electrodes have drawn
    increasing attention. With the aim to identify the exciting opportunities
    and rationalize the electrode designs, in this review, we present our
    current comprehension of bubble engineering on micro-/nanostructured
    electrodes, focusing on water splitting. We first provide a brief
    introduction of gas wettability on micro-/nanostructured electrodes. Then
    we discuss the advantages of micro-/nanostructured electrodes for mass
    transfer (detailing the lowered overpotential, promoted supply of
    electrolyte, and faster bubble growth kinetics), localized electric field
    intensity, and electrode stability. Following that, we outline strategies
    for promoting bubble detachment and directional transportation. Finally, we
    offer our perspectives on this emerging field for future research
    directions.
