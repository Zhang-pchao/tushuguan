    About half of present-day cloud condensation nuclei originate from
    atmospheric nucleation, frequently appearing as a burst of new particles
    near midday. Atmospheric observations show that the growth rate of new
    particles often accelerates when the diameter of the particles is between
    one and ten nanometres. In this critical size range, new particles are most
    likely to be lost by coagulation with pre-existing particles, thereby
    failing to form new cloud condensation nuclei that are typically 50 to 100
    nanometres across. Sulfuric acid vapour is often involved in nucleation but
    is too scarce to explain most subsequent growth, leaving organic vapours as
    the most plausible alternative, at least in the planetary boundary layer.
    Although recent studies predict that low-volatility organic vapours
    contribute during initial growth, direct evidence has been lacking. The
    accelerating growth may result from increased photolytic production of
    condensable organic species in the afternoon, and the presence of a
    possible Kelvin (curvature) effect, which inhibits organic vapour
    condensation on the smallest particles (the nano-K{\"o}hler theory), has so
    far remained ambiguous. Here we present experiments performed in a large
    chamber under atmospheric conditions that investigate the role of organic
    vapours in the initial growth of nucleated organic particles in the absence
    of inorganic acids and bases such as sulfuric acid or ammonia and amines,
    respectively. Using data from the same set of experiments, it has been
    shown that organic vapours alone can drive nucleation. We focus on the
    growth of nucleated particles and find that the organic vapours that drive
    initial growth have extremely low volatilities (saturation concentration
    less than 10(-4.5) micrograms per cubic metre). As the particles increase
    in size and the Kelvin barrier falls, subsequent growth is primarily due to
    more abundant organic vapours of slightly higher volatility (saturation
    concentrations of 10(-4.5) to 10(-0.5) micrograms per cubic metre). We
    present a particle growth model that quantitatively reproduces our
    measurements. Furthermore, we implement a parameterization of the first
    steps of growth in a global aerosol model and find that concentrations of
    atmospheric cloud concentration nuclei can change substantially in
    response, that is, by up to 50 per cent in comparison with previously
    assumed growth rate parameterizations.
