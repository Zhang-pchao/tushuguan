    Secondary organic aerosol contributes to the atmospheric particle burden
    with implications for air quality and climate. Biogenic volatile organic
    compounds such as terpenoids emitted from plants are important secondary
    organic aerosol precursors with isoprene dominating the emissions of
    biogenic volatile organic compounds{~}globally. However, the{~}particle
    mass from isoprene{~}oxidation is generally modest compared to that of
    other terpenoids. Here we show that isoprene, carbon monoxide and methane
    can each suppress the instantaneous mass and the overall mass yield derived
    from monoterpenes in mixtures of atmospheric vapours. We find that isoprene
    'scavenges' hydroxyl radicals, preventing their reaction with monoterpenes,
    and the resulting isoprene peroxy radicals scavenge highly oxygenated
    monoterpene products. These effects reduce the yield of low-volatility
    products that would otherwise form secondary organic aerosol. Global model
    calculations indicate that oxidant and product scavenging can operate
    effectively in the real atmosphere. Thus highly reactive compounds (such as
    isoprene) that produce a modest amount of aerosol are not necessarily net
    producers of secondary organic particle mass and their oxidation in
    mixtures of atmospheric vapours can suppress both particle number and mass
    of secondary organic aerosol. We suggest that formation mechanisms of
    secondary organic aerosol in the atmosphere need to be considered more
    realistically, accounting for mechanistic interactions between the products
    of oxidizing precursor molecules (as is recognized to be necessary when
    modelling ozone production).
