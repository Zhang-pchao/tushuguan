    Forests emit large quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the
    atmosphere. Their condensable oxidation products can form secondary organic
    aerosol, a significant and ubiquitous component of atmospheric aerosol,
    which is known to affect the Earth's radiation balance by scattering solar
    radiation and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. The quantitative
    assessment of such climate effects remains hampered by a number of factors,
    including an incomplete understanding of how biogenic VOCs contribute to
    the formation of atmospheric secondary organic aerosol. The growth of newly
    formed particles from sizes of less than three nanometres up to the sizes
    of cloud condensation nuclei (about one hundred nanometres) in many
    continental ecosystems requires abundant, essentially non- volatile organic
    vapours, but the sources and compositions of such vapours remain unknown.
    Here we investigate the oxidation of VOCs, in particular the terpene
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene, under atmospherically relevant conditions in
    chamber experiments. We find that a direct pathway leads from several
    biogenic VOCs, such as monoterpenes, to the formation of large amounts of
    extremely low- volatility vapours. These vapours form at significant mass
    yield in the gas phase and condense irreversibly onto aerosol surfaces to
    produce secondary organic aerosol, helping to explain the discrepancy
    between the observed atmospheric burden of secondary organic aerosol and
    that reported by many model studies. We further demonstrate how these
    low-volatility vapours can enhance, or even dominate, the formation and
    growth of aerosol particles over forested regions, providing a missing link
    between biogenic VOCs and their conversion to aerosol particles. Our
    findings could help to improve assessments of biosphere-aerosol-climate
    feedback mechanisms, and the air quality and climate effects of biogenic
    emissions generally.
