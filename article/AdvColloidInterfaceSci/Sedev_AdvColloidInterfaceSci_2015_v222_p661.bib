    The molecular-kinetic theory (MKT) of dynamic wetting was formulated almost
    50 years ago. It explains the dependence of the dynamic contact angle on
    the speed of a moving meniscus by estimating the non- hydrodynamic
    dissipation in the contact line. Over the years it has been refined to
    account explicitly for the influence of (bulk) fluid viscosity and it has
    been applied successfully to both solid-liquid- vapour and
    solid-liquid-liquid systems. The free energy barrier for surface diffusion
    has been related to the energy of adhesion. The MKT provides a qualitative
    explanation for most effects in dynamic wetting. The theory is simple,
    flexible, and it is widely used to rationalize the physics of wetting
    dynamics and fit experimental data (dynamic contact angle versus contact
    line speed). The MKT predicts an intermediate wettability as optimal for
    high-speed coating as well as the maximum speeds of wetting and dewetting.
    Nevertheless, the values of the molecular parameters derived from
    experimental data tend to be scattered and not particularly reliable. This
    review outlines the main achievements and limitations of the MKT and
    highlights some common cases of misinterpretation.
