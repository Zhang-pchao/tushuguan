    More than one century ago, Lippmann found that capillary forces can be
    effectively controlled by external electrostatic forces. As a simple
    example, by applying a voltage between a conducting liquid droplet and the
    surface it is sitting on we are able to adjust the wetting angle of the
    drop. Since Lippmann's findings, electrocapillary phenomena - or
    electrowetting - have developed into a series of tools for manipulating
    microdroplets on solid surfaces, or small amounts of liquids in capillaries
    for microfluidic applications. In this article, we briefly review some
    recent progress of fundamental understanding of electrowetting and address
    some still unsolved issues. Specifically, we focus on static and dynamic
    electrowetting. In static electrowetting, we discuss some basic phenomena
    found in DC and AC electrowetting, and some theories about the origin of
    contact angle saturation. In dynamic electrowetting, we introduce some
    studies about this rather recent area. At last, we address some other
    capillary phenomena governed by electrostatics and we give an outlook that
    might stimulate further investigations on electrowetting.
