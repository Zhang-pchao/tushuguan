    The extent of ion pairing in solution is an important phenomenon to
    rationalize transport and thermodynamic properties of electrolytes. A
    fundamental measure of this pairing is the potential of mean force (PMF)
    between solvated ions. The relative stabilities of the paired and solvent
    shared states in the PMF and the barrier between them are highly sensitive
    to the underlying potential energy surface. However, direct application of
    accurate electronic structure methods is challenging, since long
    simulations are required. We develop wave function based machine learning
    potentials with the random phase approximation (RPA) and second order
    M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory for the prototypical system of
    Na and Cl ions in water. We show both methods in agreement, predicting the
    paired and solvent shared states to have similar energies (within 0.2
    kcal/mol). We also provide the same benchmarks for different DFT
    functionals as well as insight into the PMF based on simple analyses of the
    interactions in the system.
