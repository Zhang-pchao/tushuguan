    The acid-base properties of surfaces significantly influence catalytic and
    (photo)electrochemical processes. Estimation of acid dissociation constants
    (pKa values) for colloids is commonly performed through electroanalytical
    techniques or spectroscopic methods employing label molecules. Here, we
    show that polarimetric angle-resolved second harmonic scattering (AR-SHS)
    can be used as an all-optical, label-free probe of colloid surface pKa
    values. We apply AR-SHS to dispersions of 100 nm anatase TiO2 particles to
    extract surface potential and surface susceptibility, a measure of
    interfacial water orientation, as a function of pH. The surface potential
    follows changes in surface charge density, while the interfacial water
    orientation inverts at pH {\ensuremath{\sim}}4.8, {\ensuremath{\sim}}6, and
    {\ensuremath{\sim}}7.6. As the variation in bulk pH modifies the
    populations of Ti-OH2+, Ti-OH, and Ti-O- interfacial groups, a change in
    water orientation reports on the ratio of protonated/deprotonated species.
    Such observation allows for pKa evaluation from plots of surface
    susceptibility versus pH. A Nerstian trend in the surface potential is
    additionally demonstrated.
