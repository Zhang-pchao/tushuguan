    We present a hypothesis that autoxidation (inter- and intramolecular
    hydrogen abstraction by peroxy radicals) plays an important role in the
    oxidation of organic compounds in the atmosphere, particularly organic
    matter associated with aerosol. In the laboratory, we determine the rate of
    this process at room temperature for a model system, 3-pentanone. We employ
    ab initio calculations to investigate H-shifts within a broader group of
    substituted organic compounds. We show that the rate of abstraction of
    hydrogen by peroxy radicals is largely determined by the thermochemistry of
    the nascent alkyl radicals and thus is highly influenced by neighboring
    substituents. As a result, autoxidation rates increase rapidly as
    oxygen-containing functional groups (carbonyl, hydroxy, and hydroperoxy)
    are added to organic compounds. This mechanism is consistent with formation
    of the multifunctional hydroperoxides and carbonyls often found in
    atmospheric aerosol particles.
