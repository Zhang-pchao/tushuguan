    Experimental observations have revealed molecular-scale density depletion
    near hydrophobic substrates, suggesting a diffuse and structurally
    heterogeneous fluid-solid interface. Motivated by these findings, we
    hypothesise that the surface composition at the fluid- solid boundary may
    adopt multiple energetically favourable states. To account for this
    behaviour, we introduce a nonmonotonic wall free energy formulation that
    captures the energetic contribution of the fluid-solid interactions within
    the wetting boundary condition of a thermodynamically consistent
    phase-field model. This formulation successfully reproduces multistable
    surface compositions and enables the modelling of static contact angle
    hysteresis (CAH) on smooth, horizontally oriented substrates, arising from
    deposition histories. By allowing the wall free energy to relax and permit
    contact line motion via molecular diffusion, this model captures the
    dynamic CAH observed during droplet motion on inclined substrates. Unlike
    conventional phase-field CAH models, our framework requires no explicit
    input on contact-line velocity or prescribed contact angles and relies
    solely on thermodynamic energy minimisation; it automatically captures
    contact line pinning, as well as advancing and receding states. Upon
    droplet sliding with CAH, stick-slip behaviour naturally emerges. These
    findings demonstrate that both CAH and stick- slip behaviour can originate
    purely from molecular-scale fluid-solid interactions, underscoring the
    importance of surface composition and interfacial diffusion, factors often
    overlooked in classical hydrodynamic models. This framework provides a
    pathway to bridge thermodynamic and hydrodynamic perspectives, potentially
    enabling new insights into slip, friction, and no-slip behaviour at
    fluid-solid interfaces, with particular relevance for microfluidic
    applications.
