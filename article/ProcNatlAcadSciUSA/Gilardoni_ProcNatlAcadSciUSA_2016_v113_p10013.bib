    The mechanisms leading to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
    are an important subject of ongoing research for both air quality and
    climate. Recent laboratory experiments suggest that reactions taking place
    in the atmospheric liquid phase represent a potentially significant source
    of SOA mass. Here, we report direct ambient observations of SOA mass
    formation from processing of biomass- burning emissions in the aqueous
    phase. Aqueous SOA (aqSOA) formation is observed both in fog water and in
    wet aerosol. The aqSOA from biomass burning contributes to the
    {''}brown{''} carbon (BrC) budget and exhibits light absorption wavelength
    dependence close to the upper bound of the values observed in laboratory
    experiments for fresh and processed biomass-burning emissions. We estimate
    that the aqSOA from residential wood combustion can account for up to
    0.1-0.5 Tg of organic aerosol (OA) per y in Europe, equivalent to 4-20{\%}
    of the total OA emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of aqSOA
    from anthropogenic emissions on air quality and climate.
