    Atmospheric oxidation of natural and anthropogenic volatile organic
    compounds (VOCs) leads to secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which
    constitutes a major and often dominant component of atmospheric fine
    particulate matter (PM2.5). Recent work demonstrates that rapid
    autoxidation of organic peroxy radicals (RO2) formed during VOC oxidation
    results in highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM) that efficiently form
    SOA. As NOx emissions decrease, the chemical regime of the atmosphere
    changes to one in which RO2 autoxidation becomes increasingly important,
    potentially increasing PM2.5, while oxidant availability driving RO2
    formation rates simultaneously declines, possibly slowing regional PM2.5
    formation. Using a suite of in situ aircraft observations and laboratory
    studies of HOM, together with a detailed molecular mechanism, we show that
    although autoxidation in an archetypal biogenic VOC system becomes more
    competitive as NOx decreases, absolute HOM production rates decrease due to
    oxidant reductions, leading to an overall positive coupling between
    anthropogenic NOx and localized biogenic SOA from autoxidation. This effect
    is observed in the Atlanta, Georgia, urban plume where HOM is enhanced in
    the presence of elevated NO, and predictions for Guangzhou, China, where
    increasing HOM-RO2 production coincides with increases in NO from 1990 to
    2010. These results suggest added benefits to PM2.5 abatement strategies
    come with NOx emission reductions and have implications for aerosol-climate
    interactions due to changes in global SOA resulting from NOx interactions
    since the preindustrial era.
