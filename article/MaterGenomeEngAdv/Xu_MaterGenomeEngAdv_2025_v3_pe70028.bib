    AbstractThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of the latest stable
    release of the graphics processing units molecular dynamics (GPUMD)
    package, GPUMD 4.0. We begin with a brief review of its development
    history, starting from the initial version. We then discuss the theoretical
    foundations for the development of the GPUMD package, including the
    formulations of the interatomic force, virial and heat current for
    many{-}body potentials, the development of the highly efficient and
    flexible neuroevolution potential (NEP) method, the supported integrators
    and related operations, the various physical properties that can be
    calculated on the fly, and the GPUMD ecosystem. After presenting these
    functionalities, we review a range of applications enabled by GPUMD,
    particularly in combination with the NEP approach. Finally, we outline
    possible future development directions for GPUMD.
