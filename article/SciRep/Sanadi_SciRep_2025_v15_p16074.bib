    Significant efforts have been focused on the development of non-noble metal
    electrocatalysts for efficient production of green hydrogen using renewable
    energy sources such as water and sunlight. Various transition metal oxides
    have been explored as promising candidates for hydrogen evolution reactions
    (HER), attracting considerable attention in the field of water splitting.
    In this study, we report the synthesis of anatase phase TiO2 nanoparticles
    (NPs) with a crystallite size of 6.94{~}nm, achieved through a
    co-precipitation method specifically for neutral water electrochemical HER
    applications. The as-synthesized anatase phase of TiO2 electrocatalyst have
    been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope,
    transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman
    spectroscopy, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. Transmission electron
    microscopy analysis revealed that the average particle size of the TiO2 NPs
    was approximately 5.80{~}nm. The exceptional HER performance of these
    nanoparticles can be attributed to their optimal crystallite size, rapid
    charge transfer kinetics, and reduced band gap energy. The electrocatalyst
    demonstrated an overpotential of 470{~}mV to achieve a current density of
    10{~}mA cm-2 in a 0.2{~}M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrode
    maintained stable HER activity over a continuous period of 50{~}h,
    indicating its potential for practical applications. These findings
    highlight the critical role of crystallite size optimization in enhancing
    HER activity, particularly in neutral electrolytes. By advancing the
    understanding of non-noble metal electrocatalysts, this study contributes
    to the ongoing efforts to develop efficient, sustainable methods for green
    hydrogen production, aligning with global goals for renewable energy
    utilization.
