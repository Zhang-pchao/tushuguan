    While the dynamics of hydrogen bubbles during water electrolysis have been
    intensively studied in recent years, adequate insights into the dynamics of
    oxygen bubbles are still lacking. Therefore, this study presents a
    comparative analysis of hydrogen and oxygen bubble dynamics during
    potentiostatic water electrolysis in an acidic electrolyte. Complementary
    optical techniques, such as high-speed shadowgraphy, particle tracking
    velocimetry, and schlieren imaging are applied to measure geometric
    features of the evolving bubbles and the microscale Marangoni convection,
    as well as the refractive index field around the growing bubbles. Distinct
    differences between oxygen and hydrogen bubbles are found in the average
    current, in the Marangoni convection pattern, and in the degree of
    refractive index reduction at the bubble foot, suggesting a synergetic
    action of both thermal and solutal effects at oxygen bubbles.
