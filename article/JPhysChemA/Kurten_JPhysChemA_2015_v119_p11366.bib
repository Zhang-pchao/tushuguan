    Autoxidation by sequential peroxy radical hydrogen shifts (H-shifts) and O2
    additions has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for the rapid
    formation of highly oxidized, low-volatility organic compounds in the
    atmosphere. A key prerequisite for autoxidation is that the H-shifts of the
    initial peroxy radicals formed by, e.g., OH or O3 oxidation are fast enough
    to compete with bimolecular sink reactions. In most atmospheric conditions,
    these restrict the lifetime of peroxy radicals to be on the order of
    seconds. We have systematically investigated all potentially important
    (nonmethyl, sterically unhindered) H-shifts of all four peroxy radicals
    formed in the ozonolysis of {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene using density
    functional ({\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD) and coupled cluster [CCSD(T)-F12]
    theory. In contrast to the related but chemically simpler cyclohexene
    ozonolysis system, none of the calculated H-shifts have rate constants
    above 1 s(-1) at 298 K, and most are below 0.01 s(-1). The low rate
    constants are connected to the presence of the strained cyclobutyl ring in
    the {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene-derived peroxy radicals, which hinders
    H-shifts both from and across the ring. For autoxidation to yield the
    experimentally observed highly oxidized products in the
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis system, additional ring- opening
    reaction mechanisms breaking the cyclobutyl ring are therefore needed. We
    further investigate possible uni- and bimolecular pathways for opening the
    cyclobutyl ring in the {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene ozonolysis system.
