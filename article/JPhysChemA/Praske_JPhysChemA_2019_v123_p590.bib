    Gas-phase autoxidation - the sequential regeneration of peroxy radicals
    (RO2) via intramolecular hydrogen shifts (H-shifts) followed by oxygen
    addition - leads to the formation of organic hydroperoxides. The
    atmospheric fate of these peroxides remains unclear, including the
    potential for further H-shift chemistry. Here, we report H-shift rate
    coefficients for a system of RO2 with hydroperoxide functionality produced
    in the OH-initiated oxidation of 2-hydroperoxy-2-methylpentane. The initial
    RO2 formed in this chemistry are unable to undergo
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-OOH H-shift (HOOC-H) reactions. However, these RO2
    rapidly isomerize ({\ensuremath{>}}100 s-1 at 296 K) by H-shift of the
    hydroperoxy hydrogen (ROO-H) to produce a hydroperoxy-substituted RO2 with
    an accessible {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-OOH hydrogen. First order rate
    coefficients for the 1,5 H-shift of the {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-OOH hydrogen
    are measured to be {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.04 s-1 (296 K) and
    {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.1 s-1 (318 K), within 50{\%} of the rate coefficients
    calculated using multiconformer transition state theory. Reaction of the
    RO2 with NO produces alkoxy radicals which also undergo rapid isomerization
    via 1,6 and 1,5 H-shift of the hydroperoxy hydrogen (ROO-H) to produce RO2
    with alcohol functionality. One of these hydroxy-substituted RO2 exhibits a
    1,5 {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-OH (HOC-H) H-shift, measured to be
    {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 s-1 (296 K) and {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.6 s-1 (318 K),
    again in agreement with the calculated rates. Thus, the rapid shift of
    hydroperoxy hydrogens in alkoxy and peroxy radicals enables intramolecular
    reactions that would otherwise be inaccessible.
