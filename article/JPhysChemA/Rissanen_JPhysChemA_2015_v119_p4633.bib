  abstract     = {
    Formation of highly oxidized, multifunctional products in the ozonolysis of
    three endocyclic alkenes, 1- methylcyclohexene, 4-methylcyclohexene, and
    {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene, was investigated using a chemical ionization
    atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight (CI-APi-TOF) mass
    spectrometer with a nitrate ion (NO3(-)) based ionization scheme. The
    experiments were performed in borosilicate glass flow tube reactors at room
    temperature (T = 293 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3 K) and at ambient pressure. An
    ensemble of oxidized monomer and dimer products was detected, with
    elemental compositions obtained from the high-resolution mass spectra. The
    monomer product distributions have O/C ratios from 0.8 to 1.6 and can be
    explained with an autocatalytic oxidation mechanism (=autoxidation) where
    the oxygen-centered peroxy radical (RO2) intermediates internally rearrange
    by intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions, enabling more oxygen molecules
    to attach to the carbon backbone. Dimer distributions are proposed to form
    by homogeneous peroxy radical recombination and cross combination
    reactions. These conclusions were supported by experiments where H atoms
    were exchanged to D atoms by addition of D2O to the carrier gas flow.
    Methylcyclohexenes were observed to autoxidize in accordance with our
    previous work on cyclohexene, whereas in {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-pinene
    ozonolysis different mechanistic steps are needed to explain the products
    observed.
