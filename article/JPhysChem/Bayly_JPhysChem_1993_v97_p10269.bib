    We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP)
    derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic
    potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the
    intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two- body
    additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of
    quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the
    molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that
    they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in
    related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the
    large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating
    intramolecular interactions
