    on carbon. These particles can interact with the active sites of the carbon
    to form a species a t the metal-carbon interface which is stable against
    high-temperature reduction. This interaction may occur via oxygen atoms
    bonding with both the carbon surface and iron atoms contacting the carbon.
    This oxygen could be provided by dissociation of the C O ligands during
    decomposition. The remainder of the surface Fe can exist in either a
    reduced or carburized state, but the small size of these particles results
    in either case in a superparamagnetically collapsed Mossbauer spectrum. For
    carbons with fewer active sites, more of the particles are unbound, and
    these particles sinter and carburize in a manner more similar to that of Fe
    particles supported on graphite.
