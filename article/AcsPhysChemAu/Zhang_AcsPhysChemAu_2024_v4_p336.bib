    The acid-base nature of the aqueous interface has long been controversial.
    Most macroscopic experiments suggest that the air-water interface is basic
    based on the detection of negative charges at the interface that indicates
    the enrichment of hydroxides (OH-), whereas microscopic studies mostly
    support the acidic air-water interface with the observation of hydronium
    (H3O+) accumulation in the top layer of the interface. It is crucial to
    clarify the interfacial preference of OH- and H3O+ ions for rationalizing
    the debate. In this work, we perform deep potential molecular dynamics
    simulations to investigate the preferential distribution of OH- and H3O+
    ions at the aqueous interfaces. The neural network potential energy surface
    is trained based on density functional theory calculations with the SCAN
    functional, which can accurately describe the diffusion of these two ions
    both in the interface and in the bulk water. In contrast to the previously
    reported single ion enrichment, we show that both OH- and H3O+ surprisingly
    prefer to accumulate in interfaces but at different interfacial depths,
    rendering a double-layer ionic distribution within {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 nm
    near the Gibbs dividing surface. The H3O+ preferentially resides in the
    topmost layer of the interface, but the OH-, which is enriched in the
    deeper interfacial layer, has a higher equilibrium concentration due to the
    more negative free energy of interfacial stabilization [-0.90 (OH-) vs
    -0.56 (H3O+) kcal/mol]. The present finding of the ionic double-layer
    distribution may qualitatively offer a self-consistent explanation for the
    long-term controversy about the acid-base nature of the air-water
    interface.
