    A cross-shaped transparent electrolysis flow cell was designed to
    simultaneously perform polarization experiments to about 2 A
    cm{\ensuremath{-}}2while monitoring the current response due to bubble
    formation and detachment. The flow cell was designed in order to
    accommodate a large electrolyte flow and have flow conditions similar to a
    PEM electrolyzer. Ir foil experiments using rapid electrochemical cycling
    techniques were performed first as a quality control measure for cell
    functionality. Literature quality cyclic voltammograms were obtained, with
    the anodically formed iridium oxide film growth plateauing after 1000
    cycles. The performance of four different Ti current collector meshes were
    evaluated using a commercial IrO2CCM using 3.5 M H2SO4at 21
    {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5{\textdegree}C. The best performing current collector
    mesh had the largest triple-phase boundary (TPB) length of 56 mm and a
    porosity of 52{\%}. Using Fourier Transform analysis, the bubble ratios for
    different current collector and frequency regimes were obtained. The lowest
    frequency bubble analysis ({\&}lt; 1 Hz) showed the best correlation with
    the performance of the different meshes.
